# Validate changeset for CI - ensures at least one valid changeset is added by the PR
#
# Key behavior:
# - Only checks changeset files ADDED by the current PR (not pre-existing ones)
# - Uses git diff to compare PR head against base branch
# - Validates that the PR adds at least one changeset with proper format
#
# Environment variables:
#   - GITHUB_BASE_REF: Base branch name (defaults to 'main')
#   - GITHUB_HEAD_REF: Head branch name
