# Case Study: Failing CI/CD Run — Permission Denied for JSON Measurements

**Issue**: [#46 - Fix failing CI/CD run](https://github.com/link-foundation/sandbox/issues/46)
**CI Runs**:
- [22261112919, Job 64399507098](https://github.com/link-foundation/sandbox/actions/runs/22261112919/job/64399507098) — First failure: "No such file or directory"
- [22263724056](https://github.com/link-foundation/sandbox/actions/runs/22263724056/job/64405913545) — Second failure: "Permission denied"

**Date**: 2026-02-21
**Status**: Investigation Complete — Fix Applied (v1.3.6)

## Executive Summary

This issue has two related but distinct failures:

### First Failure (Run 22261112919) — "No such file or directory"

```
cat: data/disk-space-measurements.json: No such file or directory
##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
```

Root cause: `su - sandbox` (login shell) changes CWD to `/home/sandbox`. The relative path `data/disk-space-measurements.json` then resolves to `/home/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json` — a path that was never created. **Fix**: Convert the relative JSON path to an absolute path using `realpath` before passing to `su - sandbox`. Applied in PR #47 (v1.3.5).

### Second Failure (Run 22263724056) — "Permission denied"

```
cat: /home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json: Permission denied
##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
```

Root cause: After applying the `realpath` fix, the absolute path was passed correctly, but the sandbox user still could not access the file. The GitHub Actions workspace directory `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/` is owned by `runner` and has permissions `750`, denying traverse access to the `sandbox` user (who is not in the `runner` group). The first fix granted `o+rx` only to the immediate parent `data/` directory, but not to the workspace root — so the kernel path traversal check still failed at `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/`. **Fix**: Copy the JSON file to `/tmp/` (world-accessible, mode `1777`) before running the sandbox user script, then copy it back. Applied in v1.3.6.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: `su -` (Login Shell) Changes Working Directory

The `su -` command (equivalent to `su --login` or `su -l`) simulates a full login for the target user. According to the [Linux `su` man page](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/su.1.html) and [Linuxize's su documentation](https://linuxize.com/post/su-command-in-linux/):

> When using `su -`, the command **changes the current working directory to the home directory of the target user**. All environment variables are reset to the target user's environment.

The relevant code in `measure-disk-space.sh` (line 646):

```bash
su - sandbox -c "bash /tmp/sandbox-measure.sh '$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE'"
```

Where `JSON_OUTPUT_FILE` is `data/disk-space-measurements.json` (a relative path).

**Before `su - sandbox`**: Working directory = `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox`
- Relative path resolves to: `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json` ✓ (file exists)

**After `su - sandbox`**: Working directory = `/home/sandbox`
- Relative path resolves to: `/home/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json` ✗ (file does not exist)

The sandbox-measure.sh script's `add_measurement` function then fails at:

```bash
current_json=$(cat "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE")  # Fails: No such file or directory
```

This error propagates through `set -euo pipefail`, causing the sandbox-measure.sh to exit with code 1, which then causes the outer script and the workflow step to fail.

### Why Bun Appears in the Error

The failure appears immediately after Bun installation because Bun is the **first measurement** in sandbox-measure.sh. The successful Bun installation output (`bun was installed successfully to ~/.bun/bin/bun`) appears before the JSON read failure because:

1. `measure_install "Bun" "Runtime" install_bun` — calls `install_bun` which succeeds
2. `add_measurement "Bun" ...` — calls `cat "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE"` which fails

Bun itself is **not the cause** of the failure. The error would have occurred even if Bun installation was skipped, as the JSON file issue affects all measurements.

### Why the JSON File Was "Missing"

The JSON file was never truly missing — it was created correctly at:
```
/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json
```

But the sandbox user's script looked for it at:
```
/home/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json
```

This directory (`/home/sandbox/data/`) was never created, making the path completely inaccessible to the sandbox user. Additionally, even if the directory existed, the sandbox user would not normally have write access to the runner's working directory structure.

### Contributing Factors

1. **`set -euo pipefail` in outer script**: `set -euo pipefail` at the top of `measure-disk-space.sh` (line 2) ensures any failure in the subprocess chain propagates correctly — this is correct behavior, but amplifies the visibility of the root cause bug.

2. **`su -` vs `su`**: The login shell option (`-`) was chosen deliberately to give the sandbox user a clean environment for installation. This is the correct approach for user-space installations, but requires careful handling of paths. According to [Baeldung's analysis](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/su-command-options), `su -` "simulates a full login" and "resets environment variables and changes to the user's home directory."

3. **Relative path throughout**: The JSON output file is passed as a relative path from the CLI argument `--json-output data/disk-space-measurements.json`. This relative path is never converted to an absolute path, so it becomes invalid after a working directory change.

## Solution

### Fix 1 (v1.3.5, PR #47): Convert to Absolute Path Before `su - sandbox`

Resolve the JSON output path to an absolute path before executing the sandbox user's sub-script. This ensures the path remains valid regardless of what working directory the sub-shell starts in.

```bash
JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS="$(realpath "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE")"
chmod o+rw "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS"
chmod o+rx "$(dirname "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS")"

if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]; then
  su - sandbox -c "bash /tmp/sandbox-measure.sh '$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS'"
else
  sudo -i -u sandbox bash /tmp/sandbox-measure.sh "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS"
fi
```

This resolved the "No such file or directory" error but not the "Permission denied" error.

### Fix 2 (v1.3.6, PR #48): Copy JSON File to `/tmp/` for Sandbox User Access

The deeper problem is that the sandbox user cannot traverse the workspace directory tree. The GitHub Actions workspace root (`/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/`) is owned by `runner` with permissions `750`. The `sandbox` user is not in the `runner` group, so they get `EACCES` when trying to traverse the directory — even if the file itself is world-readable.

The fix copies the JSON file to `/tmp/` (world-accessible, mode `1777`), runs the sandbox user script against that copy, then copies it back:

```bash
JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS="$(realpath "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE")"
JSON_TMP_COPY="$(mktemp /tmp/disk-space-measurements-XXXXXX.json)"
cp "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS" "$JSON_TMP_COPY"
chmod o+rw "$JSON_TMP_COPY"

if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]; then
  su - sandbox -c "bash /tmp/sandbox-measure.sh '$JSON_TMP_COPY'"
else
  sudo -i -u sandbox bash /tmp/sandbox-measure.sh "$JSON_TMP_COPY"
fi

cp "$JSON_TMP_COPY" "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE_ABS"
rm -f "$JSON_TMP_COPY"
```

### Why Fix 2 Is Correct

For the sandbox user to access a file at `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/data/measurements.json`, they need execute (`x`) permission on **every directory** in the path:

| Directory | Owner | Typical mode | Sandbox user can traverse? |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `/home/runner/` | runner | 755 | Yes (world x) |
| `/home/runner/work/` | runner | 755 | Yes (world x) |
| `/home/runner/work/sandbox/` | runner | 755 | Yes (world x) |
| `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/` | runner | **750** | **No** (no world x) |
| `.../data/` | root | was set to o+rx by Fix 1 | Yes |
| `.../measurements.json` | root | was set to o+rw by Fix 1 | Yes |

Fix 1 set `o+rx` on `data/` and `o+rw` on the file but missed `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/` which has no world-execute bit. Fix 2 sidesteps the issue entirely by using `/tmp/` which is world-accessible (`1777`).

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Walk all ancestor directories and chmod**: `chmod o+rx` every directory from `/` to `data/`. This works but widens permissions on runner-owned directories unnecessarily and has a larger blast radius.

2. **Use `su` without `-`** (no login shell): Would preserve the working directory but break user-space tool installations that expect a clean home environment. Not recommended.

3. **Pass absolute path directly from CLI**: Requires users to always specify absolute paths in the workflow, which is error-prone.

4. **Use `cd` inside `su -` command**: Adding `cd /path/to/workdir &&` before the script call would work but is fragile.

## Technical Details

### Environment Comparison

| Context | Working Directory | `data/disk-space-measurements.json` resolves to |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Runner shell | `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox` | `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json` ✓ |
| Root (outer script) | `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox` | `/home/runner/work/sandbox/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json` ✓ |
| `su - sandbox` | `/home/sandbox` | `/home/sandbox/data/disk-space-measurements.json` ✗ |

### Affected Script Section

**File**: `scripts/measure-disk-space.sh`, lines 644–649

```bash
# Execute sandbox user measurements
if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]; then
  su - sandbox -c "bash /tmp/sandbox-measure.sh '$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE'"
else
  sudo -i -u sandbox bash /tmp/sandbox-measure.sh "$JSON_OUTPUT_FILE"
fi
```

The `sudo -i -u sandbox` also creates a login shell (`-i` flag = simulate initial login), so the same path issue would affect that branch too.

### Bun Installation Script Behavior

For reference, Bun's install script (`https://bun.sh/install`) uses `set -euo pipefail` and adds `~/.bun/bin` to `$HOME/.bash_profile`. The script exits 0 on success and 1 on failure. In this CI run, Bun installed successfully (exit 0), confirming that Bun itself is not the failure source.
