# R Language
echo "==> Testing R installation..."

# Swift
echo "==> Testing Swift installation..."
echo "Method: Download official Swift toolchain from swift.org"

# Ruby
echo "==> Testing Ruby installation..."

echo "Alternative: rvm (Ruby Version Manager)"
echo "Recommended: rbenv for consistency with other version managers in the image"

# Kotlin
echo "==> Testing Kotlin installation..."

# Assembly
echo "==> Testing Assembly tools installation..."
