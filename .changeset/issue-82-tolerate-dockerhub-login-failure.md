ci(release): tolerate Docker Hub login failure so a single expired
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN no longer takes down the entire release workflow
(issue #82). Every "Log in to Docker Hub" step now uses
`continue-on-error: true` and is followed by a "Check Docker Hub
login" step that emits a clear `::warning` annotation pointing at
the rotation runbook in `README.md` and `docs/case-studies/issue-82`.
GHCR pushes proceed on their existing credentials when Docker Hub is
unavailable.

ci(release): free ~30 GB of disk space before `docker-build-test` so
the PR-CI smoke job stops failing with `no space left on device`
while building the JS -> essentials -> 11 language images -> full-box
chain on a single ubuntu-24.04 runner. Mirrors the existing
`jlumbroso/free-disk-space` step in `docker-build-push` (issue #41).

ci(release): parallelize the PR test matrix and isolate every Docker
image build on its own VM (issue #82). The single sequential
`docker-build-test` job is replaced by a chain of parallel matrix jobs:
`pr-test-js` (1 VM) -> `pr-test-essentials` (1 VM) ->
`pr-test-language` (matrix x 11 languages, parallel) ->
`pr-test-full` (1 VM, builds the full chain locally because the
`full-box` Dockerfile uses `COPY --from=*-stage`), with
`pr-test-dind` (matrix x 14 variants, parallel) running alongside
`pr-test-full` once `pr-test-essentials` finishes. A
`docker-build-test` aggregator job preserves the existing
branch-protection check name. Every build job (15 jobs:
`pr-test-*`, `build-{js,essentials,languages,dind}-{amd64,arm64}`,
`docker-build-push{,-arm64}`) now runs `jlumbroso/free-disk-space@main`
before its first build step. PR-test jobs use plain `docker build`
against the host Docker daemon (not buildx's `docker-container`
driver) so that subsequent `FROM box-js` / `FROM box-essentials`
references resolve against the locally-built images instead of
trying to pull from `docker.io`.

fix(kotlin): install Java 21 LTS alongside Kotlin in the standalone
`box-kotlin` image (issue #82). `kotlinc` is a shell wrapper around
`java`, so the language-only image previously failed
`docker run --rm box-kotlin kotlin -version` with
`line 102: java: command not found`. The full-box image was unaffected
because Java was supplied by the `box-java` stage. Now
`ubuntu/24.04/kotlin/install.sh` installs Java via SDKMAN before
Kotlin, making the standalone `box-kotlin` image self-sufficient and
unblocking the new per-language `pr-test / kotlin` matrix job.
